# useFacebookSDK
a react hook that loads facebook sdk

--- 

for some reason facebook official docs don't provide a react example
as if the react team and the social login team dont like each other :)

In any case..
This repo contains all you need to use facebook sdk in any react application.

## install
```npm
# put this in .npmrc ( either global or in a repository root ) 
@viggin543:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```
```npm
# run 
npm install @viggin543/use-facebook-sdk@1.0.1
```

Then in a react component:

```javascript


```
